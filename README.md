Geany Themes README
===================

Introduction
------------

Geany-themes is a collection of color schemes for the
[Geany IDE/editor][geany], either written originally by the Geany community
or ported from color schemes for other editors. These schemes are compatible
with Geany 1.22 and greater. Check out the [screenshots][scrn] to get an
idea for what each color scheme looks like.

Installation
------------

**Note:** the following instructions will overwrite any themes with
the same filename you have already installed, so if you have customized
any of them, you will lose your customizations if you don't back them
up first.

### Unix-like Systems

1. Extract the zip file, tarball or checkout with Git to a local
directory.
1. To install, either
    * run `install.sh` for automatic instalation or
    * Copy all of the `*.conf` files from the `colorschemes`folder
    into the `~/.config/geany/colorschemes/`.
    Create the `~/.config/geany/colorschemes/`directory if it
does not already exist.
1. Choose a new theme by selecting
`Change Color Scheme...` from Geany's `View` menu.

### Windows

Installing the themes on Windows is the same as with Unix-like systems
with the exception that the target directory will be different. With
Windows 7, the directory should be named
`C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\geany\colorschemes`, but the
exact path may vary depending on your Windows configuration and/or
version. Refer to [the Geany Manual][man-paths] for more information on
configuration file paths.

Documentation
-------------

Once you have installed the `colorschemes` directory,
restart geany and select the any of the new color scehemes via the menu:
**View -> Change Color Scheme...**.

If you want to add a theme, read the [ADDING-A-THEME.md][add-theme] file. If you
are a package maintainer, consult the [MAKING-A-RELEASE.md][make-release] file. For
all other cases, consult the official Geany documentation.

Other Themes
------------

You can also also sometimes find bleeding edge themes which have yet to
be fully integrated into the repository by looking at the
[Issues on Github][issues] labelled with the [`new-theme`][new-themes] label.
There may also be some unofficial themes on [the wiki][wiki-themes].

Be wary of old-style themes you may find in random places on the
Internet as they may only be compatible with old Geany versions before
1.22 and will likely result in grief. If the file doesn't contain a
section called `[theme_info]` it almost sure to be an incompatible
older theme. See below for more details.

Compatibility
-------------

These color schemes are not compatible with older version of Geany
prior to 1.22, including its old filetypes files, which you may have
customized and are found in your per-user configuration folder. All
bets are off if you mix and match old filetypes/color schemes and the
color schemes here. The best way to handle it is to simple move your
old filetypes out of the way, copy the ones you want to customize from
Geany's system data folder and hand-copy over the non-`[styling]`
groups from the old filetypes file into the new one.
